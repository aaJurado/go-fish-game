# Go Fish Game  
A two-player Go Fish card game built in **Python** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
Designed for coursework in the University of Maryland’s Information Science program to practice class design, testing, and game logic.

- Object-Oriented Programming (constructors, methods, encapsulation)  
- Python data structures (lists, dicts, sets)  
- Control flow and input validation  
- Unit testing with **Pytest**  
- Code readability and modularity
